        Thanks for taking an interest in me and my channel. My love for the outdoors began at a young age. I grew up always playing outside, and eventually joined the Boy Scouts. By the time I hit high school, I was hiking, and exploring regularly. I started repelling, which led to rock climbing, which led to mountaineering. I have rock climbed in California at Joshua Tree National Park, Sespe Gorge, Malibu Creek State Park, and many Unnamed crags. When I moved to Wyoming I climbed in the Unitas, usually at Ruth Lake, also in the Big and Little Cottonwood Canyons in Utah. I have also climbed and gone mountaineering in the Tetons.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
        Nowadays I do most of my outdoor adventures in the Unitas, mostly because of the close proximity to my house. I have made many summits in the Uintas, including several winter ascents. I have hiked, and backpacked in most of the drainages of the Uintas, and backpacked the high line trail (86 miles) twice.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
        I enjoy hiking, backing, horse packing, goat packing, snowshoeing, cross country skiing, and snowmobiling. Really any reason to get outdoors.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
        I am an active member of the Uinta County Search and Rescue, and teach mounted horse patrol.

        <p class="paragraph">
        I enjoy canoeing, stand up paddle boarding, and even have a small sailboat. I love getting off the trail, and fishing out of the way lakes, and streams.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
        I make several trips a year to Yellowstone National Park and occasionally Glacier National Park with my family, and I love getting off the trail and away from the crowds in the backcountry.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
        I also enjoy living history, and am a member of the American Mountain Men, and have spent many hours in the wilderness re enacting the fur trade era, using only items available in 1820 to 1840.

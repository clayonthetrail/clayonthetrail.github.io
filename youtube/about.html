                Thanks for taking an interest in me and my channel. My love for the outdoors began at a young age. I grew up always playing outside, and eventually joined the Boy Scouts. By the time I hit high school, I was hiking, and exploring regularly. I started repelling, which led to rock climbing, which led to mountaineering. I have rock climbed in California at Joshua Tree National Park, Sespe Gorge, Malibu Creek State Park, and many Unnamed crags. When I moved to Wyoming I climbed in the Unitas, usually at Ruth Lake, also in the Big and Little Cottonwood Canyons in Utah. I have also climbed and gone mountaineering in the Tetons.

                <img src="images/highline.JPG" alt="Highline Trail" id="highline">Nowadays I do most of my outdoor adventures in the Unitas, mostly because of the close proximity to my house. I have made many summits in the Uintas, including several winter ascents. I have hiked, and backpacked in most of the drainages of the Uintas, and backpacked the high line trail (86 miles) twice.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I enjoy hiking, backing, horse packing, goat packing, snowshoeing, cross country skiing, and snowmobiling. Really any reason to get outdoors.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I am an active member of the Uinta County Search and Rescue, and teach mounted horse patrol.

                <img src="images/yellowstone.JPG" alt="Yellowstone" id="yellowstone">I enjoy canoeing, stand up paddle boarding, and even have a small sailboat. I love getting off the trail, and fishing out of the way lakes, and streams.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I make several trips per year to Yellowstone National Park and occasionally Glacier National Park with my family, and I love getting off the trail and away from the crowds in the backcountry.

                <img src="images/rat.jpg" alt="Rat Rod" id="rat">I also enjoy living history, and am a member of the American Mountain Men, and have spent many hours in the wilderness re enacting the fur trade era, using only items available in 1820 to 1840.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Most recently this love for living history has led me to begin working on a rat rod. I started in 2015 with just a cab and then acquired a motor and other parts. It made its maiden voyage in February of 2017. Since then I have added a few more things as I continue the build. The most recent addition is a teardrop trailer that matches the style of my rat rod.
